# Algorithms-Project---Virus-Simulation
Mini-project for Algorithms class modeling the transmission of a virus throughout a graph of nodes.

Press g to reset simulation and generate new graph of nodes.
Hover mouse over a node and press s to start the simulation on the given node.

Hover mouse over a node and press m to give it a mask attribute.
Hover mouse over a node and press i to make in immune to infection.

Hold down a number 1-9 and then press m or i to make many nodes have a mask or be immune. Holding down 1 will convert a few nodes while holding down 9 will condert many nodes. Holding down 0 will condert all nodes.
